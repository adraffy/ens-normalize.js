## Abstract

This ENSIP standardizes, versions, and resolves implementation details of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) name normalization process outlined in [ENSIP-1 § Name Syntax](https://docs.ens.domains/ens-improvement-proposals/ensip-1-ens#name-syntax).  Since ENSIP-1 was finalized in 2016, Unicode has [evolved](https://unicode.org/history/publicationdates.html) from version 8.0.0 to 14.0.0 and incorporated many new characters, including complex emoji sequences.

The goal of this ENSIP to standardize the exact normalization algorithm, pin an explicit Unicode verison, and elucidate many implementation details and edge cases.  This ENSIP introduces an explicit set of modifications to the existing standard to reduce visually-confusing names and improve compatibility with future Unicode updates.  Additionally, a test set of 

As of this ENSIP, over 580K names have been registered on chain.  Great effort has been made to preserve as many names as possible, however some names will become unreachable if the normalization outlined in this ENSIP is applied.

## Motivation

* Since ENSIP-1, Unicode has evolved from version 8.0.0 to 14.0.0 (6 major bumps) and ENSIP does not state an explicit version number. 

* ENSIP-1 implies but does not state an explicit flavor of IDNA processing. 

* Unicode support is non-uniform across all platforms, including language-level String functions, like [Unicode Normalization Form C](https://unicode.org/reports/tr15/).

* [UTS-46](https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/) is insufficient to correctly normalize emoji. Correct emoji parsing is only possible with [UTS-51](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/).

* There does not exist a validation set of unormalized and normalized names.

* The success of ENS has encouraged spoofing&mdash;registering a visually similar name with exotic characters&mdash;via the following techniques:

	* Insertion of Zero-width Characters
	* Replacement of Look-alike (Confusable) Characters
	* Using names which normalize differently between available algorithms 


## Specification

* Normalization is the process of converting an arbitrary string into a canonical form.  

* It is idempotent:  applying normalization mutliple times produces the same result.

* It either produces a string or throws an error.

* The Unicode version is `14.0.0`

* Input is processed left-to-right, first looking for emoji sequences according to [UTS-51](https://unicode.org/reports/tr51/), and then text sequences according to [UTS-46](https://unicode.org/reports/tr46/).  

* UTS-51 parsing has the following **<u>changes</u>**:
	* <a href="#WhiteSEQ">Whitelisted sequences</a> are matched first.
    * `FE0E` is never matched.
    * <a href="#Demoji">A small set of emoji</a> are demoted from emoji because they were disallowed or mapped by legacy IDNA 2003 logic:  
        * `[0-9] FE0F` was normalized to `[0-9]` which is ambiguous with the corresponding digit character.
        * `[#*] FE0F` was normalized to `[#*]` which is disallowed.
        * Some emoji were mapped to non-emoji sequences.
	* [Tag Sequences](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/#def_emoji_tag_sequence) are disallowed (because they hide arbitrary data.)
	* [Flag Sequences](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/#def_emoji_flag_sequence) are ignored and singleton *Regional Indicators* are allowed. 
	* [Keycap Sequences](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/#def_emoji_keycap_sequence) have a special case to account for legacy normalization:
		* `[0-9] FE0F? 20E3` (where `FE0F` is optional) is parsed as `[0-9] 20E3`
		* `[#*] FE0F 20E3` is parsed verbatim
	* [Presentation Sequences](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/#def_emoji_presentation_sequence) have a special case to account for legacy normalization:
        * `$REQ FE0F` is parsed verbatim<br>where `$REQ = [203C, 2049]` is the set of all new and future emoji.
        * `$DROP FE0F?` (where `FE0F` is optional) is parsed as `$DROP`<br>where `$DROP` is the set of all emoji that were valid in IDNA 2003.
    * [ZWJ Sequences](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/#def_emoji_zwj_sequence) are either:
		* [RGI Sequences](https://unicode.org/Public/emoji/14.0/emoji-zwj-sequences.txt)
		* <a href="#WhiteNonRGI">Whitelisted Non-RGI Sequences</a>
    
	
* UTS-46 parsing has the following settings or **<u>changes</u>**:
    * *UseSTD3ASCIIRules* is `true`
    * *Transitional* is `false`
        * IDNA 2008 
        * Deviations are Valid
        * Includes NV8 and XV8
    * *CheckHyphens* is `true`
    * *CheckBidi* is `true`
    * *CheckJoiners* is `true` and uses *ContextJ* and *ContextO* rules
    * The following characters are disallowed: 
        * `(。) 3002 Ideographic Full Stop`
        * `(．) FF0E Fullwidth Full Stop`
        * `(｡) FF61 Halfwidth Ideographic Full Stop`
        * `(◌̲) 0332 Combining Low Line`
    * The following characters are allowed:
        * `(_) 005F Underscore`
        * `($) 0024 Dollar Sign`
        * `(£) 0024 Pound Sign`
        * `(¥) 00A5 Yen Sign`
        * `(€) 20AC Euro Sign`
        * `(₿) 20BF Bitcoin Sign`

* Like ENSIP-1, labels are formed from runs of emoji and text separated by a stop character.  The only valid stop character is ASCII period: `002E (.) FULL STOP`

* Each label
